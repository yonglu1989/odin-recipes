    <p>Best popcorn chicken in the multiverse!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 2x 200g Chicken Breasts</li>
        <li> 3-4 cups of oil</li>
        <li> 1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li> 200g Plain Flour</li>
        <li> 2 tsp Salt</li>
        <li> 1.5 tsp Smoked Paprika</li>
        <li> 1 tsp Baking Powder</li>
        <li> 3/4 tsp Onion Powder</li>
        <li> 3/4 tsp Garlic Powder, Black Pepper</li>
        <li> 1/2 tsp Dried Oregano</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice your chicken breasts into small even sized bite size chunks.         </li>
        <li>Combine in a bowl with your Buttermilk, 1 tsp of Salt and 1/2 tsp Black Pepper. Pop cling film over and marinate in the fridge for at least 1 hour. Preferably overnight. This will help tenderize the chicken pieces.
        </li>
        <li>In a bowl, combine your Flour, Baking Powder, 2nd tsp of Salt, Smoked Paprika, Cayenne Pepper, Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Oregano and 1/4 tsp Black Pepper.
        </li>
        <li>Take a piece of Chicken and coat it the flour mixture. Really try and get as much flour in the cracks of the chicken. You want the chicken to be nice and flakey. This is important. Although it sounds tedious to do it one by one, by this is the best way to get the best coating on the chicken. No more than 3-4 at a time max.
        </li>
        <li>Heat up 3-4 cups of oil, depending on depth of pan. You want the temp at around 180C/356F. Grab a tiny piece of leftover flour mixture and drop it in. If it sizzles and slowly rises to the top, you're good to go.
        </li>
        <li>In batches, add the chicken and fry for around 3-5mins until golden brown. Place on wire rack over paper towels to drain away excess fat. To test if they're cooked, just take one piece out and slice it through the centre. It should be white and piping hot. If you're not confident with deep frying just test with one piece at the start.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat with the rest of your batches, then serve with your favourite dip!
